# Simple-HTML-Form-with-Input-Fields-and-Buttons


This HTML code creates a form with fields for Name, Address, Email, Gender (radio buttons), Country (dropdown list), and Messages (textarea). Users can enter their information, select options, and submit or reset the form as needed. It's a basic example of how HTML forms collect user input for submission or processing.
